Dynamic Loader:
What I want to implement, is a dynamic loader that can load code and data at runtime. Basically, it is like a dynamic linker or a linux kernel module loader.
It should be able to load and link shared library in ELF format at runtime.
I want to use it as an extension of a VM. It is also a good way to study dynamic
linker and linux kernel module loader.
